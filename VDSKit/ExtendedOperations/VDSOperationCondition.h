/// @param operation The operation whose conditons need to be evaluated.

/// @param error An error aggregating any errors during evaluation. Use the return value to know when

/// @summary In many cases, a condition can be satisfied if a dependent operation is run
/// before the conditional operation is run. To accomplish this, a condition can
/// produce an operation that should be added to the conditional operation as a
/// dependency. When the conditional operation's dependencies are run, the condition
/// can be satisfied, enableing the conditional operation to successfully execute.
///
/// @note If multiple operations are needed that can not be automatically produced using
/// conditions, consider using a group operation to create a set of operations that can
/// be produced and run to satisfy the conditional operation.
///
/// @param operation The conditional operation.
/// 
/// @returns An operation than can be added to the conditional operation's dependencies
/// and that, when run, may satisfy the conditional operation's execution requirements.
///

/// @summary This instance method is the override point that enables subclasses to insert
/// evaluation logic, error reporting, and a result for a given condition.
///
/// @param operation The operation whose conditions will be evaluated.
///
/// @param error An error object describing the error. Use the return value to know when
/// to check for an error object. A return value of NO will always produce an error object.
///
/// @returns YES if the condition was satisfied, otherwise NO.
///
/// @throws If the NS_BLOCK_ASSERTIONS macro is not defined, will throw
/// NSInternalInconsistency exception if operation is nil.
