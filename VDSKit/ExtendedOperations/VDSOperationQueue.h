/// @summary VDSOperationQueueDelegate provides an interface for customizing
/// the behavior of an operation queue.
///
/// @discussion VDSOperationQueueDelegate provides behavior customization
/// control points when adding an operation and when an operation completes
/// its execution. The queue delegates primary purpose is to provide more
/// granular control over what operations get added to the queue, enabling
/// delegates to block the addition of operations and to keep track of
/// when an operation is added.
///
/// The queue also notifies its delegate when an opertion is complete,
/// enabling the queue to act as a trigger point for clean up
/// or other asynchronous behavior.

/// @discussion In some cases, operations may need to be filtered from a queue. For
/// example, if a queue only accepts a certain number of a type of operation,
/// this method can be used to prevent more than a certain number of an
/// operation type from being added to a queue at any one time. As an
/// alternative, operations can be captured and coalesced so that
/// only the most recent is executed at any time.
