/// @summary VDSGroupOperation provides a mechanism for grouping and controling
/// the execution of child operations as part of a parent operation's
/// execution.
///
/// @discussion Use VDSGroupOperation to organize the execution of a series of
/// subtasks for a larger task (the group operation). Organizing operations using
/// group operations simplifies dependency management where a series of subtasks
/// may execute independently but must all complete before considering a larger task
/// to be complete.
///
/// Group operations also provide a means of generating multiple operations for
/// a condition dependency. Conditions may only define a single operation as a
/// dependency. However, if that dependency is define as a group operation, then
/// the group operation may be defined to produce one or more subtasks (operations),
/// effectively enabling a condition to have multiple operation dependencies.
