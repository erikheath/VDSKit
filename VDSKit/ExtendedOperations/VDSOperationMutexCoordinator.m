#pragma mark - Configuration Behavior

/// When adding an operation for a condition type, this method first determines
/// whether other operations with the condition already exist. If so, the condition
/// is added to the array of operations for that condition. If not, a new array
/// for the condition is created, and then the operation is added to the new array.
///
/// As conditions are added, each one is set to be dependent on the prior one, creating
/// a dependency queue for each condition type.
///
/// To ensure thread safety, a serializer dispatch queue is used. Note that adding an
/// operation is a synchronous event, so this method will block until it completes its
/// work. This ensures that operations do not begin executing before their conditions have
/// been added to the coordinator.
///
