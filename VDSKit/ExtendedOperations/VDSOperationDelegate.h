/// @discussion VDSOperationDelegate provides behavior customization 
/// control points prior to execution, at the beginning of execution,
/// at the end of execution (pre-finishing), and before the
/// operation triggers its completion handlers. When used with
/// with a concrete VDSOperation subclass like VDSBlockOperation,
/// the delegate provides a way to create significant customization
/// without the need to create subclasses of VDSOpertion. In many cases
/// this is a better design strategy than creating numerous one-off
/// subclasses.
