/// @summary VDSBlockOperation provides a ready-made implementation of VDSOperation whose
/// execution behavior can be customized using a block.
///
/// @discussion in many instances, the behavior needed from an operation is a "one-off", and
/// creating a subclass is unnecessary. For these cases, VDSBlockOperation provides a means of
/// creating an operation with custom functionality without needing to create a subclass. When
/// combined with other block focused classes such as VDSBlockObserver, it is possible to create a
/// VDSBlockOperation that can satisfy even moderately complex scenarios such as executing a task,
/// dynamically setting up and tearing down Key-Value Observer, sending out notifications as a task
/// executes, etc.
