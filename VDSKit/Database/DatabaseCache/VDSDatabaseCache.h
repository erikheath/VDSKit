/// @summary VDSDatabaseCache provides a subclassable, enumerable, and archivable object caching system.
/// The class provides object tracking using expiration, usage, and/or max object counts and supports
/// mixing of tracked and untracked objects for maximum caching flexibility. Adding and evicting methods
/// are thread safe, as are all cache configuration properties. The class may be used as is, may be
/// safely subclassed, or may be used as a backing class for a facade that limits direct cache storage
/// manipulation to facade internals.
///
/// @discussion VDSDatabaseCache supports fast enumeration over the contents contained in its cachedObjects
/// To enumerate only those items that are tracked, use either trackedObjectsAndKeys or trackedObjects.
/// To enumerate over the items that are not tracked, use untrackedObjectsAndKeys or untrackedObjects.
///
/// The cache also supports archiving of untracked objects when archivesUntrackedObjects is set to YES. To
/// archive tracked objects, create a subclass of VDSDatabaseCache and override initWithCoder: and
/// encodeWithCoder:, calling the super class methods to encode the configuration (and untracked objects
/// if desired).
///
/// When encoding, use trackedObjectsAndKeys to iterate and create a new dictionary of only the tracked
/// objects that can be encoded. When decoding in the initWithCoder: method,
/// make sure to use the setObject:forKey:tracked method to add the objects to the cachedObjects internal
/// tracking system. Otherwise the formerly tracked objects will become untracked.
///
/// @note Archiving tracked objects can become complicated when expiration is determined by an external
/// source, such as a remote store or web service. In these instances, it is genrally a good idea to rerequest
/// all of the cached items last-updated timestamps and compare them to the timestamps of the objects
/// that have been loaded into the cache. Objects that are no longer valid (i.e. don't exist) can be
/// removed from the cache. Objects that exist but need to be refreshed can be requested in full and then
/// updated. This process enables you to have data immediately available, while only updating objects where data
/// has actually changed.

#pragma mark Eviction Behaviors

/// @summary Immediately attempts to launch the eviction process on the eviction queue. This
/// method does not indicate that evictions were completed successfully, only that an eviction
/// operation has been created and placed on the eviction queue.
///
/// @discussion Evictions are performed in a series cancellable operations: one for expired objects, one
/// for cache size maintainance, and one for usage. Subclasses can add eviction operations
/// or override the dependency chain to reorder, and therefore reprioritize how the eviction
/// process works. For more information, refer to the class documentation for
/// VDSEvictionOperation.
///
/// This method is triggered by the evictionLoop timer periodically according to the evictionInterval
/// property.
///
/// @param timer The timer that triggered the execution of the method.

/// @summary Attempts to evict objects from the cache that meet the eviction criteria
/// specified in the configuration.
///
/// @discussion The cache takes an aggressive approach, removing objects that are
/// unused and expired, according to the eviction policy, regardless of the max object count.
///
/// The database cache will decrement the object count for any object that has expired.
/// If the cache is configured to track uses and the object has no additional uses,
/// then the object will be removed.
///
/// If cache is configured to remove items that have expired regardless of use,
/// then the expired object will be removed. Otherwise, it will be left in the cache.
///
/// If the object has not expired but has no users, then the object will be removed if
/// the cache exceeds the max object count. Otherwise, the object will be left in the cache.
