/// @summary Indicates the preferred maximum number of objects the cache should hold.
/// This is a target amount, not a fixed ceiling. The cache will attempt to keep the number
/// of objects near this amount whenever possible while satifying other configuration
/// constraints.
///
/// @discussion Setting a value of 0 indicates there is no maximum. The default is 0.
/// Setting a value less than 0 indicates that the cache should evict objects as soon as possible. When setting

/// to prevent the cache from prematurely evicting objects after they have been added.

///
/// @discussion When tracks Usage is enabled, added objects automatically receive
/// a usage count of one. When the object expires, that usage count is decremented
