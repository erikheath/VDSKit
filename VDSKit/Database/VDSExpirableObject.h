/// A VDSExpirableObject associates a an expiration date with an object. Typically
/// this is used as a convenient way to track and order objects for time-based
/// processing.
///
/// @discussion For example, a cache could use expirable objects in a
/// time sorted list to quickly determine which objects have expired
/// and therefore are no longer valid when accessed.
///
/// VDSExpirableObject overrides its hash method to enable searching for the
/// object stored in its object property. This enables finding an object using
/// isEquals where either the receiver or comparison object can be the object
/// property instead of a VDSExpriableObject.
///
/// @note VDSExpirableObject does not support archiving objects can expire while
/// archived, leading to VDSExpirableObject instances entering an inconsistent state.
///

/// property is not KVO compliant.
///
@property(strong, readonly, nonnull) id object;


/// Indicates if the object has expired. Once set to YES, this value is fixed,
/// however the value will only change when requested (when read). This property
/// is KVO compliant.
///
/// @note While KVO compliant, this property should not be used to be notified when an instance
/// expires. This is because the notification is only dispatched when the value is read,
/// not when the object actually expires. It is, however, useful for housekeeping purposes
/// such as creating a removal list during other processes.
