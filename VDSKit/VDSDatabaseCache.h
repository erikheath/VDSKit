/// @summary VDSDatabaseCache provides a subclassable, enumerable, and archivable object caching system.
/// The class provides object tracking using expiration, usage, and/or max object counts and supports
/// mixing of tracked and untracked objects for maximum caching flexibility. Adding and evicting methods
/// are thread safe, as are all cache configuration properties. The class may be used as is, may be
/// safely subclassed, or may be used as a backing class for a fascade that limits direct cache storage
/// manipulation to fascade internals.
///
/// @discussion VDSDatabaseCache supports fast enumeration over the contents contained in its cachedObjects
/// property. To enumerate only those items that are tracked, obtain the keys from the evictionPolicyKeyList
/// and use them to enumerate the tracked objects contained in the cache.
///
/// To enumerate over the items that are not tracked, create a mutable set of keys from the cachedObjects
/// dictionary, a set from the evictionPolicyKeyList, and take the difference between the two sets. The
/// resulting set will be all of the keys that correspond to the untracked objects.
///
/// The cache also supports archiving of untracked objects when archivesUntrackedObjects is set to YES. To
/// archive tracked objects, create a subclass of VDSDatabaseCache and override initWithCoder: and
/// encodeWithCoder:, calling the super class methods to encode the configuration (and untracked objects
/// if desired). Use the evictionPolicyKeyList to iterate and create a new dictionary of only the tracked
/// objects that can be encoded and decoded, or use the previously mentioned untracked objects enumeration
/// method to create a set of untracked object keys, converting it to an array and then using it as the input
/// to the removeObjectsForKeys: method on a mutable copy of the cachedObjects dictionary. The result of
/// either technique is a mutable dictionary that can be encoded. When decoding in the init method, make sure
/// to use the addTrackedObject method to add the objects to the cachedObjects mutable dictionary. Otherwise
/// the objects will become untracked.
///
/// @note Archiving tracked objects can become complicated when expiration is determined by an external
/// source, such as a remote store or web service. In these instances, it is genrally a good idea to rerequest
/// all of the cached items last-updated timestamps and compare them to the timestamps of the objects
/// that have been loaded into the cache. Objects that are no longer valid (i.e. don't exist) can be
/// removed from the cache. Objects that exist but need to be refreshed can be requested in full and then
/// updated. This process enables you to have data immediately available, while only updating objects where data
/// has actually changed.

#pragma mark Cache Storage

/// The main storage for the cache. Objects are store using a globally unique (for the cache) key
/// that is used throughout the cache tracking system to refer to the object.
///
/// @discussion It is possible to add cache objects directly without using the tracking system,
/// mixing both tracked and untracked objects. This use case is desirable when some objects should be
/// tracked for removal, while other objects should effectively be persistent (at least for the life
/// of the cache). This design can be more desirable, and simpler than constructing expressions to set
/// expiration dates far into the future for a subset of objects in the cache. This also allows you to
/// ignore usage rules for certain objects.
///
/// Typical uses of untracked objects include permanent or semi-permanent lookup tables (e.g. zip codes,
/// state abbreviations, flight numbers, etc.), data loaded from local sources, or reference data for tracked
/// objects that should only be evicted when the tracked object is evicted.
